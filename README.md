# Working Schedule

Working Schedule is a simple and efficient way to manage weekly staff schedules based on workload and availability. The program collects workload data from users, calculates the necessary staff needed for each day, and updates multiple Google Sheets to reflect this information.

It handles inputs for each day of the week, checks staff availability, and provides a clear output of the required staffing. Additionally, it organizes data in an easily referenceable format, automating the generation of weekly working schedules based on team capacity and workload distribution.

Integrating with Google Sheets allows for real-time updates, ensuring the schedule reflects the latest staff availability and task requirements. Each team member can manage 5 tasks per day, enabling the system to calculate and assign the appropriate number of staff per day. It also generates a random schedule based on the provided information.
